In the unlikely event that we do not reach our funding goal, every penny donated will still go straight to our business. Meeting our funding goal would ensure that we do not have to take out a loan. Why We're Different We realize as cocktail enthusiasts that your local liquor store already has a whole shelf of flavored vodkas and traditional bitters. We feel that our products are unique enough to stand out. Spirit Bar infusions aren't created from artificial flavorings and don't contain added sugar. They are an exciting option for those with mature palates who are ready for something new and exciting. Take our Wild Weed Blend, for example. Starting with a gluten free neutral spirit, we infuse chamomile, lemon balm, and dandelion root to create an herbaceous, easy to drink liquor that soothes your stomach and nerves. Other Ways You Can Help If you are not able to contribute to our campaign financially, please consider: Sharing our campaign with 2 or 3 of your friends and asking them to do the same.
